# React TodoApp Testing

This is a simple todo app with the following features:  

🧪 Tests for base scenarios ([React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/))  
🐶 Type checking, linting ([ESLint](https://eslint.org/)), code formatting ([Prettier](https://prettier.io/)) and running tests with Git hooks ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky))  
✅ Simple CI pipeline ([GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)) setup for type checking, linting, code formatting, running tests and making sure that the project builds without a problem
